      <h1>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity</h1>

      <p class="a">
        Below, I examine four websites, covering the four essential web design
        principles, as titled above.
      </p>

      <h2 class="a">Contrast</h2>
      <a class="a" href="https://www.apple.com/"><strong>Apple</strong> </a>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Apple web site showed a great example of “Contrast” by having a black
          background.
        </li>
        <li>
          The black and silver camera floating around in the center of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          The clickable links which bring up more to the menu as you hover over
          them, they get brighter.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="a border">Repetition</h2>
      <a
        class="a"
        href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime?tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=550213431242&hvpos=&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14371123558740153030&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031977&hvtargid=kwd-3151046130&ref=pd_sl_34qfrygf2i_e"
        ><strong>Amazon</strong></a
      >
      <ol>
        <li>
          Amazon has shown great repetition on their website by the way placed
          their items in different categories with white backgrounds behind each
          one and by having different layers.
        </li>
        <li>And even the % off was used flush left on each item.</li>
        <li>
          The footer categories were set it repetition as well how they
          highlighted.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="a">Alignment</h2>
      <a class="a" href="https://medium.com/"><strong>Medium</strong></a>
      <dl>
        <dt>Why Just the Shop Page?</dt>
        <dd>
          Even by opening the site on your cell phone the site is easy to
          navigate.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          I also like the way that the search menu bar was directly in the
          middle of the page.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>
          The items on the front page were used with great alignment though out
          the website.
        </dd>
        <br />
      </dl>

      <h2 class="a">Proximity</h2>
      <a
        class="a"
        href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/35128357?adults=1&category_tag=Tag%3A5348&children=0&enable_m3_private_room=true&infants=0&pets=0&photo_id=826702440&search_mode=flex_destinations_search&check_in=2023-10-22&check_out=2023-10-27&source_impression_id=p3_1695414886_0MV77y5jacwMY3IE&previous_page_section_name=1000&federated_search_id=c51c066"
        ><strong>Airbnb</strong></a
      >
      <ol class="a">
        <li>
          This website Airbnb as you click on map it shows you pictures exactly
          where you will be staying.
        </li>
        <li>I also noticed that it shows you how much you will be spending.</li>
        <li>
            This website gives you a map the proximity on the time that you will
          be spending at the location.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h1>In Conclusion...</h1>
      <p>
        I noticed most websites that I got my examples from actually exhibited
        multiple design<br />
        elements of the four that we learned in the assignment. It really helps
        one realize the<br />
        importance of incorporating these into web design.
