    Art has always been a massive part of my life. I remember my first art class, my teacher telling me that my art was not good enough and feeling like it was and how I never wanted to draw again and how I wished that I would have taken my time. Even as a child I strived for the best from my work. I prefer Fine Art to anything else, as fine art to me has more potential in it to embrace the artists’ emotions and can contain more depth and concept than any other media. Art has helped me in the healing process of myself. When I paint or draw something, only I know it is true meaning. It is like a secret between me and the canvas and no one is ever going to find out. I love that about art. You can be yourself, and it does not judge you. Instead, it takes everything positive you have and amplifies it, making you and your soul infinitely beautiful. When I found out that I could express myself and vent through something so simple as art, I dove into it, how I could get involved, how I could help others the way I wish someone with a colorful piece of art of themselves or even a loved one. To be able to help someone who needs my help sparks a fire in me to do art even more. To be honest, during my first year of high school I suffered brain cancer before I started college, I suffered from depression and anxiety. This set me back a bit and made me rethink the whole University situation. Whether I really wanted it? Whether I really needed it? After two of getting better, I realized: yes, it is what I need, and most definitely what I want. Being a little bit older than I was, and being a whole lot more committed, I know my mind is in a better place than it was years ago. It has given me time to think about what I really want to do with my life, what I want out of it and what I want to give back. When I found out that I could express myself and vent through something so simple as art, I dove into it, how I could get involved, how I could help others the way I wish my junior high teacher would have spent more time and helped me earlier in my life? Then I found it, art therapy. That is my goal in life. To be able to help someone who needs help. To be qualified and experienced and confident enough to help a stranger, through the means that I found so helpful and rewarding. But in the meantime, I would like to study art and an academic course to feed my love of learning, and by the end of it, apply for a teaching course and qualify as an art teacher. During the years studying at Peralta Colleges to now, I have had a few jobs here and there, giving me experience in the real world, only making me realize that I need to be surrounded by people with a similar mind to mine. However, the experience I had has been most useful and rewarding. I have worked with many loved ones as well as friends and the community that I live in with art from painting, fine art, and business staple, where I gained a lot of organizational skills, and a business frame of mind. I gave excellent customer service and had clients ringing back to thank me personally. This made the idea of me helping people amplify in my mind, as it felt good to; firstly, have such nice feedback; but secondly, to know I helped someone out and made their day that little bit easier. I was commissioned to do a glass painting in 2018 for Marshawn Lynch. And have been working on similar projects ever since. I have a lot of ideas I would like to have the ability to conduct. My home space is not big enough to fulfil all my artistic needs, so I have started channeling my creativity into graphic art as well as working with the Fab Lab at Alameda College. I love the range you can get with just a button, but nothing beats getting your hands dirty and having everything you have worked on mapped out in front of you. In my spare time, I am on my computer finding photos of friends and family to draw witch has been very successful unique style of art I’ve been told is different from others most artist draw and paint on paper as well as canvas, my preference is glass, plywood anything that I can find and get my hands on mi painting on it. Looking at my art I see evidence of great artwork, in my graphics field I have been able to create my own logo designs, or poster designs, or textile designs, etc. which has been phenomenally successful with get my business, artwork noticed. I am very serious about art and have been all of  my live, many people that know me says that I am the life of the party, I have been a character, I gave myself the nickname "Goofy" witch has stuck with me for some years now, when someone asks me to create a project weather it’s a painting or a graphic arts or even a drawing I make it a priority to get it done as soon as possible. My art reflects myself. I show myself through my assorted styles of art whether it is a fine, graphic arts peace I try to keep it all the same. My unique identifiable style most definitely makes my art stand out, to this day I have not seen anybody creating art on the materials such as I do. I am willing to accept any jobs from designing logo’s, poster design, character animator, illustration my mind I open any job that comes my way. I will not people to know about my artwork is that I have a limit to what I will do and do and what I will not do. People should look to hire me because my art is long lasting and one of a kind.

    Soon to be one…
